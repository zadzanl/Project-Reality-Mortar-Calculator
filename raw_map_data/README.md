# Raw Map Data

This directory contains server.zip (heightmaps) and client.zip (minimaps) files extracted from Project Reality: BF2 installation.

## Structure

```
raw_map_data/
├── manifest.json              # Map inventory (generated by collect_maps.py)
├── muttrah_city_2/
│   ├── server.zip            # Heightmap data from game installation
│   └── client.zip            # Minimap textures from game installation
├── fallujah_west/
│   ├── server.zip
│   └── client.zip
└── ...
```

## How to Populate

Run the collection script from the project root:

```bash
python processor/collect_maps.py
```

This script will:
1. Auto-detect PR:BF2 installation
2. Copy server.zip files (heightmaps) to this directory
3. Copy client.zip files (minimaps) to this directory
4. Generate manifest.json with metadata for both file types

See `processor/README.md` for detailed instructions.

## Git LFS

If total size exceeds 10MB, Git LFS will be configured automatically by the collection script.

Large files are tracked by Git LFS to avoid bloating the repository.

## Do Not Modify Manually

This directory is managed by `collect_maps.py`. Manual modifications may cause issues with the processing pipeline.

For custom maps, place both server.zip and client.zip files in a subfolder (e.g., `custom_map_name/server.zip` and `custom_map_name/client.zip`) and the processor will detect them.
